		Construct a catcher flow procedure.

		This will return a catcher function which should
			be returned to catch a callback.

		Passing a custom method to letgo executes the method after consuming the callback
			and after executing the catcher function. This will provide for a more
			specific flow of procedures.

		Passing a custom method will change the flow of the procedure. The method
			is executed once and the result will be saved forever.
